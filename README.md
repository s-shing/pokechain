# Pokechain
## Intro
PokeChain is an NFT-based marketplace that allows you to trade Pokémon in return for FT (Yoda). PokeChain is based on the game Pokémon and acts as a tool to manage in-game trades and provide an abstract, legitimized marketplace. Like Pokémon, you can capture Pokémon (minting), level them, and trade them. Ideally, the use would be to track Pokémon, manage leveling, and initiate trades among Pokémon players, as well as provide a unified currency for these transactions. Previously, a Pokémon trainer had to find someone to trade with through various means, whether it be a common trade, like with a friend or someone nearby, or a less common trade, like someone you met only for trading. Pokechain provides a marketplace catered to most instances of valuable trades, but does not limit invaluable trades. It allows people to connect over Web2 and legitimizes the trade using Web3 through mutual agreement. This allows you to track the occurrences of trades and the value of the Pokémon.
